# Loops

Loops can be used to execute same code multiple times or. Either to do same thing or similar thing thanks to change in variable values.

There are two distinct ways how to loop either till something happens for that we have **while** construct or loop X number of times for that we have **for** construct.

## While

While loop is most universal loop available in Javascript. It can be used generally though other loops are better for specific situations.

Main usage of while loop is do something until something happens. But it can be used as replacement for other types of loops too.

Standard while loop syntax looks like:

    while (condition) {
        // code to run
    }

`condition` is either bool variable or expression resulting in bool value. Which defines if code inside of loop should be executed.

### Do while variant

Is specialized variant which ensures that code is executed at least once before condition is checked.

## For

For loop is loop which is used mostly in situations when we know how many times we need to execute it.

## Looping through collections

### For..of

### Map

### Filter
