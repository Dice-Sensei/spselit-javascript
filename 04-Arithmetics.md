# Arithmetics

In most programs at least basic arithmetics are used.

## Arithmetic Operators

Basic arithmetic operators are:

`+` addition

`-` subtraction

`*` multiplication

`/` division

Addition ones are:

`%` modulus (division reminder)

`++` increment (same as +1)

`--` decrement (same as -1)
