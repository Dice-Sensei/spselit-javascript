# Functions

Functions are a way how to reuse blocks of code. So we don't have to write it again.

Or a way to organize code for easier manipulation.

Note: If the purpose of function is reusability it should be either simple or universal.

## Execution

Functions are executed by **invoking** (**calling**) them. That is done by using function **name** and adding `()` (brackets) after it. If function have declared parameters, arguments for them are placed inside of `()` (brackets).

Example: Calling function `log` on **console** and providing it with one string argument with value `"Still here!"`.

    console.log("Still here!");

### Missing ()

### Invoking non existent function

## Creating function

Functions can be created in 3 ways. Either via **declaration** or as an **anonymous function** or as an **arrow function**.

### Declaration

### Anonymous functions

TODO: example on array

### Arrow functions

TODO: example on array (upgrade anonymous function)

## Parameters vs arguments

**Parameters** and **arguments** have slightly different meaning but are mostly used interchangeably. **Parameters** are variables which are declared in function definition. **Arguments** are variables which are provided to function when it is invoked.

Note: Even professional programmers are using these two most of the time interchangeably.
