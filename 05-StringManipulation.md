# String Manipulation

String manipulation is pretty common task in web development.

## Declaring String

As already mentioned string is: just a normal text of variable length and can be written either by using `''` (single quotes) looking like `Hey it is me ...` or by using `""` (double quotes) looking like `"Hey it is me ..."`.

## Concatenation

## String Literals

## New Line

For adding new line to string we can use either escape sequence `\n` in the string. For example:

    //command / script execution
    let newLineString = "And the winner is:\nJason";
    console.log(newLineString);

Or we can use enter in string literal. For example:

```
    //command / script execution
    let newLineStringLit = `Expected outcome of race is:
Michael Beckenbauer
Sawatari Kouki
Ishigami Fuujin`;
    console.log(newLineStringLit);
```
